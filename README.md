## Initial Data Preprocessing Requirements

- Data Collection
- Data Type Definition
- Data Quality
- Integration, Aggregation, and Display
- Data Cleaning
- Dimension Reduction
- Subset Selection
- Feature Engineering
- Discretization and Binarization
- Handling Missing Values Strategy

The first part of this project aims to preprocess the data to enable a more robust and accurate analysis. To start with preprocessing, you can follow the steps and tasks mentioned above to prepare the data for your further analysis.

## Usage

First of all install the needed python libraries and jupyter notebook.
To check the data types and fit/transform utils of data go ahead in terminal and run: `python preprocessingdata.py`
To get more detailed view of dimension reduction open terminal and execute: `jupyter notebook` after that a browser page will be opened so you can run in one cell that is: `reduced_df` and will have the dimension reduction output like below:

```
